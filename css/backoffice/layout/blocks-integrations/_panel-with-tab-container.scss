// IMPORTANT: We have to cancel the panel padding because the tab-container already has its own.
// - As the tab-container can be used outside a panel in another type of block, we can't remove it from its partial (_tab-container.scss)
// - This kind of file is the place where *integrations* like this are supposed to be done, keep this in mind when integrating others blocks

// Note: This might not be named well, maybe "tab-container-within-panel" would have been better?
